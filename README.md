# Automatic Multi-camera Extrinsic Calibration
A final year engineering project.

This project made use of Convolution Neural Networks to track and identify calibration points in videos from multiple surrounding view points.
The project made use of OpenCV libraries to assist with computer vision applications as well as trajectory optimisation in an attempt to reduce error and the influence of outliers.
